[Baadal](http://www.iitd.ac.in/content/baadal-iitd-computing-cloud) is the orchestration software for the IITD academic cloud. In this project, we explore different strategies for improving the VM scheduling and migration policies used by Baadal, by modeling the problem as a vector bin-packing problem. Currently, Baadal relies on using the first-fit strategy for scheduling VMs on Physical Machines (PMs). We proposed new algorithms and techniques to improve the scheduling capacity of Baadal and, after that, provided an analysis of the same using a simulation written in Python, which grabs real-time data and graphically shows and compares various policies. Using the simulations, we compared and verified our optimizations against the approximate and optimal solutions obtained using Linear Programming (LP).
