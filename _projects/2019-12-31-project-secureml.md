## Broader Picture
This work is part of a larger project - namely [EzPC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ezpc-easy-secure-multi-party-computation/) (Easy Secure Multi-party Computation), being pursued at Microsoft Research India, with an aim to increase the adoption of Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) as a tool for various privacy-preserving tasks. The current work can be seen as an attempt to increase the usage of MPC for secure inference of large real-world neural networks. Have a quick look at the project's description in this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1H1Sp-_5YU).

## Details
This is an ongoing work, where we are trying to construct efficient (semi-honest and malicious) multi-party computation protocols, for secure inference
of ML algorithms in a 2-party setting.
