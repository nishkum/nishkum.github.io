Most of the Q&A websites have an option to assign appropriate labels/tags to each question. The task of automatically predicting such tags or labels for each question is of great importance. It helps such websites in categorizing all the questions to make it more user-friendly and, at the same time, helps the experts, who answer the questions, to quickly find the questions related to their area of expertise. Many times a new user doesnâ€™t know
how to tag a question appropriately, or even a past user may find it difficult to assign an appropriate tag so that the right audience can find that question. In such cases, automatic prediction of tags will ensure that the question is answered quickly as right experts are more likely to
find it. In this paper, we use the data of Stack-Exchange websites like Stack Overflow, Math Overflow, etc. to create an automatic tag recommendation system. Our experimentation on the dataset provided by the Kaggle competition shows that our system has an average accuracy of 75% for most frequent tags which is an improvement from 68% as proposed by Avigit K. Saha et al. Our system shows an improvement of recall@5 from 52.4% of Avigit et al. to 56.1%.
