In this project, I worked on designing and prototyping an improved version of secondary backup to Azure in [Microsoft Data Protection Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/dpm/dpm-overview?view=sc-dpm-1801) (DPM) using Point-in-time copy semantics. To do this, I designed and developed an OS-level component for change tracking on a volume in the DPM server using bitmaps. With this, I demonstrated an end-to-end working prototype of improved secondary backup to Azure. In the end, I received an offer from Microsoft Corp. to join them full time after graduation.
