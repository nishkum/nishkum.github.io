excerpt: 'In this project, we explored the setting of a data-owner interacting with two non-colluding malicious servers and how this can be leveraged to increase the efficiency of different cryptographic primitives and protocols. In particular, we developed a keyless protocol for supporting Proofs of Retrievability in this setting and explored how to do function computation more efficiently.'

In this project, we explored the setting of a data-owner interacting with two non-colluding malicious servers and how this can be leveraged to increase the efficiency of different cryptographic primitives and protocols. In particular, we developed a keyless protocol for supporting Proofs of Retrievability in this setting and explored how to do function computation more efficiently.
