Hi, my name is Nishant Kumar. I am currently a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research Lab, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) working with [Dr. Nishanth Chandran](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nichandr/), [Dr. Divya Gupta](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/digup/), [Dr. Rahul Sharma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rahsha/) and [Dr. Aseem Rastogi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/aseemr/).

Broadly, my research interests include theory and practice of [Cryptography and Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography). I have also had the chance to explore secure enclaves like [Intel SGX](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx).

Before this, I spent 2 years working as a Software Engineer in the [Azure Backup](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/backup/) team of Microsoft. Even before that, I graduated with a B.Tech in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/) from [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in/) in 2016. During my undergradute studies, I was extremely fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Shweta Agrawal](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~shwetaag/index.html), who introduced me to the wonderful world of Cryptography and Security.

I sometimes [blog](/year-archive/) about random thoughts and ideas.
