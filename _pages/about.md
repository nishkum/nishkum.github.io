I am a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research Lab, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/). Here I work in the [EzPC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ezpc-easy-secure-multi-party-computation/) (Easy Secure Multi-party Computation) group with [Dr. Nishanth Chandran](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nichandr/) and [Dr. Divya Gupta](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/digup/). My research interests include theory and practice of Cryptography. 

Prior to this, I completed my Bachelors in Technology in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/) from [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in/). During my undergradute studies, I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Shweta Agrawal](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~shwetaag/index.html), who introduced me to the wonderful world of Cryptography. In between my undergraduate days and my stint at Microsoft Research, I also spent some time exploring the industry side of things, working as a Software Engineer in the [Azure Backup](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/backup/) team of Microsoft.
