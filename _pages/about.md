I am a PhD student in the [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) department at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I am advised by [Dr. Dakshita Khurana](http://www.dakshitakhurana.com/). My research interests include both theoretical and applied aspects of cryptography. 

Previously, I spent two years as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/) at [Microsoft Research Lab, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), where I worked in the cryptography group, on the [EzPC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ezpc-easy-secure-multi-party-computation/) ([Easy Secure Multi-party Computation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1H1Sp-_5YU)) project with [Dr. Nishanth Chandran](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nichandr/), [Dr. Divya Gupta](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/digup/), [Dr. Aseem Rastogi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/aseemr/) and [Dr. Rahul Sharma](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/sharmar/). 

Before that, I completed my Bachelors of Technology in [Computer Science](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/) from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IIT Delhi), where I was advised by [Dr. Shweta Agrawal](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~shwetaag/index.html). I have also spent time working as a Software Engineer in the [Azure Backup](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/backup/) team of Microsoft, where I worked on building [this](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-backup-for-sql-server-in-azure-virtual-machines-now-generally-available/).
