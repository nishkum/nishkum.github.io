I am a PhD student in the CS department at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I am advised by [Dr. Dakshita Khurana](http://www.dakshitakhurana.com/). My research interests include both theoretical and applied aspects of cryptography. 

Previously, I spent two years as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/) at [Microsoft Research Lab, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), where I worked in the cryptography group, on the [EzPC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ezpc-easy-secure-multi-party-computation/) ([Easy Secure Multi-party Computation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1H1Sp-_5YU)) project with [Dr. Nishanth Chandran](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nichandr/), [Dr. Divya Gupta](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/digup/), [Dr. Aseem Rastogi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/aseemr/) and [Dr. Rahul Sharma](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/sharmar/). 

Prior to Microsoft Research, I completed my Bachelors of Technology in [Computer Science](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/) from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IIT Delhi). During my undergradute studies, I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Shweta Agrawal](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~shwetaag/index.html). In between my undergraduate days and my stint at Microsoft Research, I also spent some time exploring the industry side of things, working as a Software Engineer in the [Azure Backup](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/backup/) team of Microsoft. The project I worked on there was released [publicly](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-backup-for-sql-server-in-azure-virtual-machines-now-generally-available/) as part of Azure.
